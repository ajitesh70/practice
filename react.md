## Introduction
This document explains **React JS** and **NPM** including what they are, why they are used, and their key features. It is written in README.md format for easy usage in documentation, GitHub repositories, and learning references.

---

## What is React JS
React JS is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It uses a component-based architecture where the UI is broken into reusable components.

React improves performance using a Virtual DOM that updates only the changed parts of the UI instead of reloading the entire page.

---

## Why React JS
- Fast rendering using Virtual DOM  
- Reusable components reduce development time  
- Easy to build scalable applications  
- Strong community and ecosystem  
- Easy integration with backend APIs  
- Supports modern development workflows and CI/CD pipelines  

---

## Key Features of React JS
- Component-based architecture  
- Virtual DOM  
- One-way data binding  
- Reusable UI components  
- SEO friendly (with server-side rendering)  
- Easy testing and debugging  
- Rich ecosystem of libraries  

---

## What is NPM
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager used to install, manage, and update JavaScript libraries and tools. It comes bundled with Node.js.

NPM allows developers to manage project dependencies and automate tasks using scripts.

---

## Why NPM
- Automatically installs project dependencies  
- Manages package versions and compatibility  
- Supports automation using scripts  
- Provides access to millions of open-source packages  
- Integrates easily with frontend and backend frameworks  

---

## Key Features of NPM
- Package installation and upgrades  
- Dependency resolution  
- Version locking using package-lock.json  
- Script execution  
- Global and local package management  
- Secure package publishing  
- CI/CD compatibility  

---

## React and NPM Relationship
NPM is used to install and manage React and its related packages.

Example:
```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

Create a new React project:
```bash
npx create-react-app myapp
```

NPM manages all dependencies required by React applications.

---

## Common Commands

Check Node and NPM version:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start React application:
```bash
npm start
```

Build application:
```bash
npm run build
```
