## What is NPM
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager used to install, manage, and update JavaScript libraries and tools. It comes bundled with Node.js and helps developers manage dependencies, versions, and scripts in a structured way.

NPM maintains a file called `package.json` that stores project metadata and dependency information.
